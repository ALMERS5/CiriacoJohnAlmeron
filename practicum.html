        <h1>Nature of the Tasks Given</h1>
        <p>
          During the internship at Amkor Technology Philippines, the intern was assigned meaningful tasks aimed at enhancing both technical and industry-related skills. The main project involved migrating existing internal software and web forms to a newer version called iWorkflow, which offers improved data validation and accessibility. The intern accomplished five major tasks, with three centered on system development and two dedicated to comprehensive documentation. Development tasks included building the Maintenance Work Order Module, Database Request Form Module, and Customer Specific Report Request Form Module using the iWorkflow system. For documentation, the intern created detailed user manuals for the Asset Tracking System and the Maintenance Work Order Module, featuring step-by-step guides with visuals. These tasks allowed the intern to apply academic programming knowledge in a real-world environment while gaining experience in low-code development, documentation, and industry-standard practices.

        <h1>Synthesis of the Practicum Engagement</h1>
        <p>
          The on-the-job training at Amkor Technology Philippines provided a meaningful and eye-opening experience, offering insights into corporate work culture, project development, and professional collaboration. The intern learned the importance of following structured workflows, experienced the full software development lifecycle, and received mentorship on both technical and ethical practices. Realizations included the demanding nature of corporate protocols, the complexity behind even simple tasks, and the critical role of interdepartmental collaboration in successful project development. Regular meetings with various professionals also highlighted the value of communication and teamwork. Overall, the practicum strengthened the internâ€™s technical skills, improved communication abilities, and built confidence in handling real-world projects within a professional environment.
